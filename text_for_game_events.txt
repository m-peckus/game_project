Certainly, here's a rough outline of how you might accomplish each step using pygame:

Initialize the font:

# Initialize pygame font
pygame.font.init()
# Create a Font object
font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)  # None for default font, 36 for size
Copy icon
Render the message:

# Render the message
text_surface = font.render('Spaceship crashed :(', True, (255, 255, 255))  # White color
Copy icon
Display the message:

# Assume 'screen' is your pygame display surface
screen.blit(text_surface, (50, 50))  # Position the text at (50, 50) on the screen
pygame.display.flip()  # Update the screen
Copy icon
Remember to place this code where you handle the spaceship collision. You may need to adjust the positioning and colors to fit the aesthetic of your game. Does this help you understand how to get started with displaying messages using pygame?
